# snakes-and-ladders

A simple Clojure implementation of Snakes and Ladders.

## Usage
Naturally, you'll need Clojure and Leiningen, and then should be as simple as:

    cd snakes-and-ladders
    lein run

It doesn't quit when you close the window right now, you'll have to ctrl-c.

It's still largely intended to be run interactively from the repl.
core.clj has simle control expressions at the bottom.

Then mouse-clicks roll the (invisible) die and automatically move the pieces.

Currently, the only way to start a new game is to restart
